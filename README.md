# Jwt_SpringBoot
JWT Authentication Service in Spring Security
This project implements a JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication service for Spring Security applications. It utilizes the io.jsonwebtoken library to generate, validate, and extract information from JWT tokens.

## Features:

>1. Generates JWT tokens for authorized users.
>2. Validates JWT tokens during user authentication.
>3. Extracts user information (e.g., username) from valid tokens.
>4. Uses a secret key for signing and verifying tokens (stored securely using environment variables or a dedicated secret management solution - not included in this example).
>5. Employs HMAC SHA-256 algorithm for secure token signing.

## Benefits:

>1. Provides a stateless authentication mechanism (tokens don't rely on server-side session management).
>2. Enhances security by using secure algorithms and secret keys.
>3. Improves scalability as tokens can be validated by any server within the application.

# Getting Started:

## Prerequisites:

>1. Java Development Kit (JDK)
>2. Maven (or similar build tool)

## Clone the repository:

```git
Bash

git clone https://https://github.com/Abhishek8293/Jwt_SpringBoot.git
```
## Configure environment variables:
Set the environment variable JWT_SECRET with your desired secret key (a long, base64-encoded string).

## Run the application:
```git
Bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

# Usage:

## Generating Tokens:
The JwtService class provides a generateToken(String username) method to generate a JWT token for a given username.

## Validating Tokens:
The JwtService class provides a validateToken(String token, UserDetails userDetails) method to validate a JWT token and check if it belongs to the provided user.
